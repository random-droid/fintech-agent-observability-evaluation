"""
Module A Demo: Agent Observability with LangSmith
----------------------------------------------------
Demonstrates why observability matters for multi-agent systems.
Shows how silent failures occur and how LangSmith traces reveal them.

Segments covered:
  1. Silent failure demo — agent gives a plausible but wrong answer
  4. Monitoring overview — tagging runs, viewing aggregate data

print("""
1. Every query generates 2+ LLM calls (supervisor + agent)
2. Policy queries are most expensive (supervisor + retriever + LLM with context)
3. Traces show EXACTLY where failures occur — which run, which input/output
4. Tags let you slice monitoring data by agent type, model version, etc.
5. LangSmith captures all of this automatically for LangChain/LangGraph

Next: In the exercise, you'll set up tracing yourself and inspect traces.
